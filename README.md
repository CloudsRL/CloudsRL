Hello, world!   ^v^ 

This is CloudsRL, a Master of Information and Communication Engineering in reading.

(I just pass the exam, will go to collage in September)

What I'm doing recently is learning Python and deep learning.

In actually, I'm not good at this field but this is where i'm interested.

For some well-known reasons, I can't go to this site very often. But if anyone would like to interact with me, I'd be happy to communicate with you.   ^v^

Last, I know maybe it sounds like a joke, but what I still want to say is that I want to learn the new tech ,and put it into our real world, to make our world better.  ^v^
